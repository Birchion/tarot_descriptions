Page of Pentacles Reversed

Upright, the Page of Pentacles is a very hardworking newcomer. They don't talk much and they're not very social, but they are honest, diligent, organized. They're also clever with their hands and able to fix things; often also a health nut.

Reversed our Page of Pentacles is one of those new guys who cares too much about money ("Will we be getting overtime?" he'll always ask when you want him to do more). Go out to coffee with him and he will insist on separate checks. He pays only his share. Likewise, his area is his area. Don't step into his cubical, don't touch anything. If not asked to do something, he won't do it. Very unhelpful.

If not a person, Page of Pentacles can be a message regarding money, business affairs, good news about health or luck, winning the lottery even. Reversed and you get the negatives - bad news about money, business, health - and you didn't win the lottery or if you did, you have to pay a lot of taxes.
