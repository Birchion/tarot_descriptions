Page of Swords Reversed

Upright, our Page of Swords is a chatty newcomer, interested in just about everything, fully of fresh new ideas and the desire to learn; he may be something of a story teller. He's also clever and likely very good with the computer.

The reversed, negative qualities include lying, gossiping, and being a know-it-all. He may spread stories about people, say inappropriate things, waste his time on the computer in chat rooms, etc. Do not, under any circumstances, trust this person with a secret - they won't keep it.

If upright and not a person, this card is about messages reflecting legal matters, solutions to problems, or amusing stories. If reversed, they may well be messages that contain malicious gossip, inaccurate stories, news of illness or negative legal matters.
