Six of Pentacles Reversed

The generosity card is about balancing out the scales by giving - or receiving. This is a card about finding an answer in charity, and the querent might be on either end of it - sharing the wealth, or getting their share from some benevolent soul. Reverse this, however, and there is no money to share. The querent may want to share in order to solve a problem, but finds themselves short of cash. Likewise, they may need some generosity in order to survive, but there is no one willing to give them a helping hand.

If I got this card I would assume that the querent either was having trouble getting a scholarship or charity, or that they wanted very badly to help someone but hadn't the resources to do it.
