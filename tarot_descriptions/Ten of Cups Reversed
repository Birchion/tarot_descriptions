Ten of Cups Reversed

This is a card about the spiritual bliss of love, love in partnership and in family, love in the home. There is affection and warmth, joy and harmony.

Reversed: In essence, reversed this card is a disruption of the harmony. Someone in the family, or something in the partnership is making it hard to maintain the love. This may be as simple as a child throwing temper tantrums or a teenager rebelling. Or it may be a bit darker than that - a husband/wife with a vice or addiction or psychological problem that is getting worse and eroding what would otherwise be a happy home.

The difference here between Nine of Cups and Ten of Cups: the Nine of Cups reversed is like going to a family party or dinner and everyone is shouting or making trouble; disruption is total, the family is in pieces. In Ten of Cups reversed there is the feeling that all was well - and could be well again - but for one, disruptive problem that is eating away at the soul of the family. There is a focus and a center to what is turning the family up-side-down. It isn't, as at our reversed tavern in the Nine of Cups, a free-for-all.

This makes Ten of Cups more problematic. In Nine of Cups, as discussed, we can conclude there's no wishing this away and best to cut ties. But in the Ten of Cups, there is no wish to cut ties or give up on the person. The erosion is slow but equally devastating, like rust. The person causing the problem is still loved, still part of the family...but what can be done?
